# K8s Ansible Environment
## Based kairen/kubeadm-ansible
Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with kubeadm. The goal is easily install a Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - CentOS 7
  - Debian 9

System requirements:

  - Deployment environment must have Ansible `2.4.0+`
  - Master and nodes must have passwordless SSH access

# Usage

Add the system information gathered above into a file called `hosts.ini`. For example:
```
[master]
10.10.10.11

[node]
10.10.10.[12:13]

[kube-cluster:children]
master
node
```

Before continuing, edit `group_vars/all.yml` to your specified configuration.

For example, I choose to run `flannel` instead of calico, and thus:

```yaml
# Network implementation('flannel', 'calico')
network: flannel
```

**Note:** Depending on your setup, you may need to modify `cni_opts` to an available network interface. By default, `kubeadm-ansible` uses `eth1`. Your default interface may be `eth0`.

After going through the setup, run the `site.yaml` playbook:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook site.yaml
```

Download the `admin.conf` from the master node:

```sh
$ scp k8s@k8s-master:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf .
```

Verify cluster is fully running using kubectl:

```sh

$ export KUBECONFIG=~/admin.conf
$ kubectl get node
NAME      STATUS    AGE       VERSION
k8s-master1   Ready     22m       v1.6.3
k8s-node1     Ready     20m       v1.6.3
k8s-node2     Ready     20m       v1.6.3

$ kubectl get po -n kube-system
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-k8s-master1                            1/1       Running   0          23m
...
```

# Resetting the environment

Finally, reset all kubeadm installed state using `reset-site.yaml` playbook:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook reset-site.yaml
```
